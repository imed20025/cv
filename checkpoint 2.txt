✅ Part 1: Spot the 5 Mistakes in the Resume
Lack of Specific Metrics or Achievements

Issue: Phrases like “Managed various projects successfully” and “Improved company processes” are too vague.

Fix: Add quantifiable results, e.g., "Managed 8 projects with budgets totaling $500K, delivering all on time and under budget."

Unclear or Inconsistent Formatting

Issue: Inconsistent use of punctuation and formatting (e.g., some job durations have months, others don’t).

Fix: Ensure consistent date formatting and bullet style throughout.

Weak or Generic Language

Issue: Overuse of broad verbs like “Worked with several teams.”

Fix: Replace with specific, strong verbs like “Collaborated with cross-functional teams to…”

Missing Job Title in Header

Issue: The resume doesn’t have a target job title or professional summary at the top.

Fix: Add a headline or summary, such as “Project Manager | Web Developer | Agile Specialist.”

Lack of Customization / Context for Skills

Issue: Skills are listed without context or proof of application.

Fix: Mention how these skills were applied in job descriptions or projects.

✅ Part 2: How to Fix Each Issue – With Examples
Issue	Fix Example
Vague achievements	“Managed various projects successfully” → “Led 10+ projects with 95% client satisfaction.”
Inconsistent formatting	Standardize date formats: “May 2018 to Dec 2019” → “May 2018 – Dec 2019”
Weak language	“Worked with several teams” → “Collaborated with design, QA, and dev teams to launch a new CRM tool.”
No job title / summary	Add: **"Project Manager & Web Developer
Skills lack context	Add skill usage in context, e.g., “Used Docker to containerize a Python-based CI/CD pipeline.”
